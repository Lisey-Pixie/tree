Idea for coding camp is to create a tree identifier of the main native species of Virginia.
You will be using python to code 
Species of tree will be identified through the leaves: 
    simple or compound
    number of leaflets
    lobed or not lobed
    number of lobs
    toothed edges or not
    if the teeth line up with the veins or not
start with maple, poplar, oak tree
1. find the diffferent leaf classifications of each tree
2. use python and if then statements to create a way to figure out wich tree it is
